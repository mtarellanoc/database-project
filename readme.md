This Project I create a database for a client "Little Lemon" Restaurant. This projects uses MYSQL Workbench to design and create a Database Schema. Once this was done, SQL was use to create virtual tables, procedures and prepared statements to help facilitate daily reports for LIttle Lemon. Additionally the use of Tableau was used to create a dashboard using sample data. Finally a database client was created using Jupyter Notebook.
